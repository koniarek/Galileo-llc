        <h2>Life in Poland</h2>
        <p>Poland – a country which resides on what was formerly known as Eastern Europe – is a country whose tourist star is dramatically rising.
          A place which has long been steeped in tradition and history, it’s also a land of a land of considerable natural beauty with whose idyllic lakes, beaches and mountains which are perfectly juxtaposed to the cultural rigours of the historic cities. It has a very rich culture especially with its historical churches and museums. Poland, a country that has seen hundreds of wars throughout its history, completely erased from the map, and has undergone various resistances, has overcome all these difficulties and has been able to bring its values to this day. We can say that the stability and economy of the country are almost not affected by some crises happening around the world. Therefore, it receives serious investments, especially from other countries of Europe.
          <br>

            <h3>1. Low Unemployment</h3>
            <p>
              It may not be so good in every part of the country, but in the southern west, in the Lower Silesia region, unemployment is very low and you can choose between many different companies. Big or small, production or services, Polish or foreign – the choice is yours.
              They say that wages in Poland are low, but the cost of living also isn’t very high (at least not as high as in Western cities). Good thing is that salaries are growing every year and there are pay rises at the beginning of each year. Also, if you decide to change your job you will get yourself a salary increase for sure.
              However, Poland and Lower Silesia offer much more than only working in worldwide companies from all branches of the economy.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Place of our activity is Wrocław</h3>
            <p>
              It lies on the banks of the River Oder in the Silesian Lowlands of Central Europe, roughly 350 kilometres from the Baltic Sea to the north and 40 kilometres  from the Sudeten Mountains to the south. The official population of Wrocław in 2019 was 642,869, with a further 1.25 million residing in the metropolitan area.
              Wrocław is a university city with a student population of over 130,000, making it arguably one of the most youth-oriented cities in the country. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the University of Wrocław, previously Breslau University, has produced 9 Nobel Prize laureates and is renowned for its high quality of teaching. Wrocław is classified as a Gamma- global city by GaWC. It was placed among the top 100 cities in the world for the Mercer Quality of Living Survey and in the top 100 of the smartest cities in the world in the IESE Cities in Motion Index 2017 and 2019 report.Wrocław also possesses numerous historical landmarks, including the Main Market Square, Cathedral Island and the Centennial Hall, which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
              In 1989, 1995 and 2019 Wrocław hosted the European Youth Meetings of the Taizé Community and hosted the Eucharistic Congress in 1997 and the 2012 European Football Championship. In 2016, the city was a European Capital of Culture and the World Book Capital. Also in that year, Wrocław hosted the Theatre Olympics, World Bridge Gamesand the European Film Awards. In 2017, the city was host to the IFLA Annual Conference and the World Games. In 2019, it was named a UNESCO City of Literature.  Most famous attractions in Wrocław : Hala Stulecia, ZOO & Afrykarium Wrocław, Hydropolis, Panorama Racławicka, Ostrów Tumski, Rynek, Muzeum Narodowe, Fontanna multimedialna, Ogród Japoński, Narodowe Forum muzyki, Opera wrocławska,   Krasnale (Dwarves),

              Moreover we have much more interesting places to visit, such as : Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Gdansk, Torun or Zakopane
            </p>
            <h3>3. Extraordinary mountains, reservaties, lakes and sea</h3>
            <p>
              Nature plays a significant role in the Polish life. We are proud of our nature and we would like our guests to enjoy it as well. Feel free to discover the treasures of Polish nature!
              You certainly do not associate Poland with deserts, do you? Well, don't be surprised to encounter such extraordinary natural environments in this country! A two hour drive from the airport of Gdańsk one can easily find wandering sand dunes. Near the summer resort of Łeba you'll get a chance to feel a little bit like in Africa - however the temperatures are definitely much more friendly.
              The Polish coast consists almost entirely of sand. Are you a beach lover? Do not miss the unique Hel Peninsula - a long and small bit of land and a summer paradise at the same time. However Hel has got much more to offer: It is paradise for Kite and windsurfers, conditions are unique ! If you aren't into sports, you can also find a seal aquarium, several military objects from WWII and a lighthouse.
              The North-eastern part of Poland is well known for its lakes. The Great Masurian Lakes offer you countless tranquil spots where you'll easily regain your balance and get a chance to admire the beauty of nature. Poland's largest lake, Śniardwy, is located here - as well as other pearls such as Jeziorak, Łuknajno and Hańcza.
              Fancy a visit at an unusual garden? Who doesn't! We'd like to recommend the unique theme garden Hortulus. Several different gardens in the same place are available for visitors: Japanese garden, French garden, Mediterranean garden, water garden, stone garden, aroma garden, colour garden.
              It's impossible to talk about Polish nature and miss the spectacular primeval forest of Białowieża and its mighty inhabitants - the wisents. There is scarcely a better place to witness the forest that originally covered vast areas of Europe. Even in the major Polish cities you are able to get in touch with nature. In the very heart of Wrocław you will find lots of parks and theme gardens in a middle of a city such as Japanese Garden, or Botanical Garden


              Nature can sometimes be featured on the UNESCO world heritage list. An example? The Hala Stulecia. How about a visit to the underground world? Don't miss the exciting Jaskinia Raj (Paradise cave) in the Świętokrzyskie mountains or Jaskinia Niedźwiedzia (Bear Cave) . Its extraordinary stalactites seem to come from a fairy tale.
              Plateau mountains? Yes, we've got them as well here in Poland. The Stołowe mountains are covered with luscious forests and the local birdlife attracts many birdwatchers. But the key factor is the stunning views!
              When people in Poland say 'mountains', they usually mean the unique Tatra mountains. Located just south of Cracow, near the ski resort Zakopane, the Tatra mountains are astonishing with their character and the fantastic views. Do not miss the Morskie Oko - a lake hidden amongst the mountain tops!
              A different type of Polish mountains are the Bieszczady-mountains, often referred to as Poland's wildest mountain range. The relatively low Bieszczady are perfect for hikers longing for wild nature. If you'd like to take a glimpse at wolves and bears and if you don't need wifi or spa to be lucky - Bieszczady's the place to be! In Poland we use to say “ Quit everything and visit Bieszczady”
              Are you still thinking that Poland is grey, boring and polluted? We hope we managed to convince you that this country really is worth paying a visit. See you in Poland!
            </p>
            <h3>4. Don’t be afraid of polish language!</h3>
            <p>According to the 7th edition of the EF EPI ranking covering 80 countries, Poles took 11th place in terms of knowledge of the English language. The Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries are in the lead. Even if you ask someone who does not speak english, Poles are a polite, kind and educated nation, so someone will help you.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Well-developed infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Highways provide from eastern lakes to western forests and from mountainly south to the northern seaports. All of main economic regions, well known tourist attractions and main airports are perfectly connected. Cities offer all the services and entertainment one needs, but visiting in the village is also good idea for a roundtrip!
              Since we join the EU, they granted our country to equalize regions. You can find things to do and visit all over Poland.
              Besides, our traffic jams are nothing compared to those in Western Europe.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Safety</h3>
            <p>No earthquakes, no tornadoes or hurricanes, no volcanoes, no tsunamis, no drifting ice mountains, no terrorist attacks.</p>

            <h3>7. Weather</h3>
            <p>Summer is summer, winter is winter. There’s a big distinction between seasons which makes life more interesting. We have fresh scented air in spring, scorching hot in summer, colourful leaves in autumn and snow in winter.
